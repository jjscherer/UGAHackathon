Welcome to the Dawg Directory!
```

This application was designed using Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JQuery, and MongoDB in order to provide UGA students primarily with a communal place to traverse classes. The primary feature currently is a syllabus archive, where ideally students can upload syllabi from previous semesters to help aid others in class choices.

Current Set-Up: Run all front-end code through a browser as per usual. For the backend and DB, make sure to have Docker installed so you can run the `docker-compose.yaml` file within the `dawgDirectory` subdirectory. This will set-up the database on your PC.

For future iterations of this program, we would like to incorporate other communal aspects, such as a weekly artboard and UGA class forums.
